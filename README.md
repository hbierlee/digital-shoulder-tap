# Digital Shoulder Tap
Digital Shoulder Tap, or simply Tap, provides the solution to a problem that many people in offices all over the world face every day: co-workers who are working with their headphones on are hard to reach. This often leads to annoying situations where you are shouting at the top of your lungs, and everyone in the office is distracted except the person that you're trying to reach. Tap provides an easy solution to this problem: it allows you to send a tap to your co-worker, and they will receive a small notification and a ping on their headphones, indicating that you are trying to reach them.

## Why tap and not a chat app?
Chat apps quickly get distracting in office settings, so people turn them of. Tap solves this, since it is only useful to contact people that are physically near you, otherwise they are not be able to respond. A second advantage over chat apps is that tap lets you know whether someone is reachable or not. If you send a tap, you can be sure that someone will notice it.

## Installation
Tap can be easily installed on Windows, Mac and Linux. You just need to run it to try it. If you like it and would like to keep it, you can add it to your startup programs, and it'll be there when you need it.
